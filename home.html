<strong>Motivational</strong>
<br>
<br>
<li>That sense of accomplishment in finishing a project or finding a solution is often what drives and motivates further learning and work as a software engineer. The feeling of accomplishment that comes with solving complex problems is not limited to just technical challenges.</li>
<br>
<li>Interactivity makes it easy for students to revisit specific parts of the subjects, to explore them more fully, to test ideas, and to receive feedback. By integrating technology into the classroom, students will easily get engaged in the learning process because learning becames more accessible and fun.</li
